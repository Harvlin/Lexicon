    question: "Do I need any software installed?",
    answer: "No! Lexicon runs entirely in your web browser. You can access all features including video lessons, interactive code labs, and AI tools without downloading anything. We're also fully compatible with mobile devices."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I share my subscription with a team?",
    answer: "Yes! Our Team plan supports up to 5 members and includes team progress dashboards, shared study plans, and admin controls. For larger organizations, we offer custom enterprise solutions with bulk pricing."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I miss a dayâ€”will I lose my streak?",
    answer: "We understand life happens! You get one 'streak freeze' per week, and we offer gentle reminders rather than harsh penalties. Our goal is to support your learning journey, not stress you out."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI-powered learning work?",
    answer: "Our AI analyzes lesson content to generate personalized summaries, create practice quizzes, build flashcard decks, and answer your questions. It also tracks your progress to recommend the most relevant content for your learning goals."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of content can I learn from?",
    answer: "We offer video snippets (5-15 minutes), interactive code labs, text-based articles, and downloadable cheat sheets. All content is designed for micro-learning and can be consumed during short breaks in your day."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a mobile app?",
    answer: "Currently, Lexicon is web-based and fully responsive on mobile browsers. A dedicated mobile app is on our roadmap and will be available after we complete the web platform."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you recommend content to me?",
    answer: "Our recommendation engine uses collaborative filtering (similar learners), content-based similarity (topic matching), your role and goals, and trending content in your field to suggest the most relevant lessons."
